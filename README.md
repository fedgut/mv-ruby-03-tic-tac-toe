<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Implementation of the famous game Tic Tac Toe using Ruby.



### Built With

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Tic Tac Toe

The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3 x 3 grid, or four in a row in a 4 x 4 grid. 

To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3 x 3 or 4 x 4.

The player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or all nine squares are filled.

If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three of their Os in a row, then that player wins.

If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

Gameplay is the same if you are playing on a 4 x 4 grid. The "X" player goes first. And, players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until a row is completed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all 16 squares are filled. If all 16 squares are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game is a draw.
